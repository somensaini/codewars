// Find the missing letter

// Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

// You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
// The array will always contain letters in only one case.

function findMissingLetter(array) {
  let first = array[0].charCodeAt(0)
  for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (first + i !== array[i].charCodeAt(0)) {
      return String.fromCharCode(first + i)
    }
  }
}
